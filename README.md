# Overview

The purpose of the current LaTeX class, `yathesis`, is to facilitate
dissertations’ typesetting of theses prepared in France, whatever disciplines
and institutes. It implements most notably recommendations from the Ministry of
Higher Education and Research and this, transparently to the user. It has also
been designed to (optionally) take advantage of powerful tools available in
LaTeX, including packages:
- [`biblatex`](http://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex) for the bibliography ;
- [`glossaries`](http://ctan.org/pkg/glossaries) for the glossary, list of
  acronyms and symbols list.

The `yathesis` class, based on the book class, aims to be both simple to use
and, to some extent, (easily) customizable.
