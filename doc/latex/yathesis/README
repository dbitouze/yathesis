The yathesis bundle provides a LaTeX class file to help to write a
thesis following French rules.

Installation
------------

The class is supplied in dtx format and as a pre-extracted zip file,
yathesis.tds.zip. The later is most convenient for most users: simply unzip
this in your local texmf directory (and, if needed, run `texhash' to
update the database of file locations). If you want to unpack the dtx
yourself, running 'xetex yathesis.dtx' will extract the class whereas
'xelatex yathesis.dtx will extract it and also typeset the documentation.

             *                            *
             * Both require XeTeX engine! *
             *                            *
             ******************************

Typesetting the documentation also requires:

1. a number of packages in addition to those needed to use the yathesis class.
To compile the documentation without error, you will need the packages:

- afterpage
- amsthm
- biblatex
- booktabs
- calc
- cleveref
- csquotes
- enumitem
- fixfoot
- floatrow
- footmisc
- glossaries
- hologo
- letltxmacro
- libertine
- listings
- marginnote
- multicol
- nameref
- parskip
- pdflscape
- rotating
- siunitx
- subcaption
- tabulary
- tcolorbox
- thmtools
- varioref
- xifthen
- xpatch
- xspace
- zref

2. a complete pdflatex run of these.tex to be found in the 'sample'
subdirectory of the current directory, with 'demo-yathesis' load at first
place. If latexmk is available, it is easier to run:

  latexmk -f -pdf -jobname=these -pdflatex="pdflatex %O '\RequirePackage{demo-yathesis}\input{%S}'" these.tex

3. to run xelatex on yathesis.dtx. If latexmk is available, it is easier to
run:

  latexmk yathesis.dtx
